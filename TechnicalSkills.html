        <h1>Technical Skills</h1>
        <p>I have had the priviledge of being able to work on several technical projects througout my college career. I have listed some of them below:</p>
        <h2>Retreat Web Application</h2>
        <p>Over this past summer (and continuing into the present) I worked on a full stack internal project at my internship. 
            Here we used .NET, React, and SQL to create a web application for an internal company retreat. I also learned the Scrum methodology.</p>
        <h2>Shop Compare App</h2>
        <p> During the summer of 2021, I worked on a 6 person team developing a mobile grocery applications using Kotlin and Swift.
            The purpose of this app was to showcase common cybersecurity vulnerabilities for the purpose of teaching others about them.
