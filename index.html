                <p class="text">My name is Hayden Demny! I am a computer engineering graduate from Texas A&M University. I am originally from a town called Magnolia, Texas; about an hour north of Houston. I have a passion for helping others and solving problems, and the fast paced environment of consulting really appeals to me. I also love interacting with people and learning new things. I am currently seeking full time employment opportunities. I am an outgoing individual with a desire to work hard and continue to grow my knowledge and experience. In this website you will find more information about my skill set and past projects. Thank you for visiting my webpage!
