                <h1>Howdy!</h1>
                <p class="text">My name is Hayden Demny! I am a senior computer engineering student at Texas A&M University. I am originally from a town called Magnolia, Texas; about an hour north of Houston. I decided to come to Texas A&M because both of my parents were Aggies, and I love the traditions and values of this school. I chose to major in computer engineering after building a computer of my own in high school. I enjoyed seeing the inner workings of a computer and how all of the parts worked together. I wanted to design and implement computer systems. After getting further into my degree, I realized that I enjoy writing software more than designing hardware, so I focused on the software track of computer engineering. Over this past year, I have delved into the realm of software and management consulting.
                    I have a passion for helping others and solving problems, and the fast paced environment of consulting really appeals to me. I also love interacting with people and learning new things. Some fun facts about me, I am one of three siblings. I have a twin <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdemny/">sister</a> who is an engineering student at Texas A&M and a younger <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashton-demny-325b67231/">brother</a> who is also an engineering student at Texas A&M. I am a musician, I play the euphonium, think baby tuba, and was in the marching band in high school. In college, I was also a member of the <a href="https://musa.tamu.edu/concert/">Texas A&M Symphonic Band</a> for two years. I am currently seeking full time employment opportunities. I am an outgoing individual with a desire to work hard and continue to grow my knowledge and experience. In this website you will find more information about my skill set and past projects. Thank you for visiting my webpage! If you would like to reach out and chat, I have included my contact information in the links below.
